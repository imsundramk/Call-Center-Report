# Call-Center-Report
This project analyzes call center performance using Power BI. It tracks KPIs like Total Calls, FCR %, CSAT %, Service Level, and Agent Performance. Interactive visuals (line, bar, column, donut charts) with slicers help monitor trends, improve efficiency, and support data-driven decision-making.
# Call Center Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing call center performance metrics and building an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor KPIs such as call volume, resolution rate, customer satisfaction, and agent efficiency.

The dashboard enables stakeholders to track overall call center performance, compare agent effectiveness, and make data-driven decisions.

## Objectives
- Monitor total calls answered and call handling trends  
- Evaluate agent performance and productivity  
- Track CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) and FCR (First Call Resolution)  
- Measure service level, average resolution time, and percentage of calls answered  
- Provide interactive filtering using slicers (Month, Day, Quarter, Agent Name)

## Tools & Technologies
- Data Source: Call center dataset (CSV/Excel)  
- Data Visualization: Power BI  
- Data Cleaning & Transformation: Power Query in Power BI  
- KPIs Used: FCR %, CSAT %, Service Level %, % Calls Answered, Avg Resolution Time
